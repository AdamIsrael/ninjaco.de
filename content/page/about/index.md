I'm currently a senior software engineer at [Vapor.io](https://www.vapor.io/), where (among other things) I work on [telemetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry) at the edge.

Previously, I was a Technical Lead at [Canonical]([https://](https://canonical.com/)), where my focus was on making software easier to operate at scape. I also participated in the [Open Source Mano](https://osm.etsi.org/) project as a Module Development Lead, working on day 0/day 1 operations of telco workloads.

I have over twenty years of professional experience working with everything from desktop to backend applications across more than a dozen languages. I consider myself to be more of a jack of all trades, but I'm particularly interested in things that improve the developer experience (building libraries, writing documentation).

My current work primarily involves Python and Go. I've also been teaching myself Rust since 2022, by re-implementing GNU [Coreutils](https://github.com/AdamIsrael/coreutils/) and writing a [GEDCOM 5.5.1 parser](https://github.com/adamIsrael/rust-gedcom).
