I'm currently a Senior Engineer I at [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), where I work on platform infrastructure.

Previously, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at [Vapor.io](https://www.vapor.io], where (among other things) I worked on edge data center telemetry. I was also a Technical Lead at [Canonical]([https://](https://canonical.com/)), where my focus was on making software easier to operate at scale. I also participated in the [Open Source Mano](https://osm.etsi.org/) project as a Module Development Lead, working on day 0/day 1 operations of telco workloads.

I have over twenty years of professional experience working with everything from desktop to backend applications across more than a dozen languages. I consider myself to be more of a jack of all trades, but I'm particularly interested in things that improve the developer experience (building libraries, writing documentation).

My current work primarily involves Python and Go. I've also been teaching myself Rust since 2022, by re-implementing GNU [Coreutils](https://github.com/AdamIsrael/coreutils/) and writing a [GEDCOM 5.5.1 parser](https://github.com/adamIsrael/rust-gedcom).
